# 🕵️‍♂️ Anon Chat Documentation
> Built by the Anon Ghibli Project

## What is Anon Chat?
**Anon Chat** is the first-of-its-kind anonymous messaging system built specifically for Discord communities. It enables **NFT holders and users** to engage in **public, private, and governance conversations** without revealing their identity — empowering open dialogue while protecting individual expression.

### Use Case Highlights
- Create a **safe space** for honest discussion.
- Encourage **constructive community feedback**.
- Enable **anonymous DAO governance**.

---

## Why Anon Chat Matters
In many Web3 communities, people hesitate to:
- Share critical feedback
- Offer controversial ideas
- Speak openly due to identity-based pressure

**Anon Chat removes this fear**, allowing users to share openly and honestly — leading to better engagement, feedback, and governance.

---

## 🛡️ Abuse & Moderation
Anon Chat includes built-in **AI moderation** to detect and block:
- Hate speech
- Threats or incitement
- Harmful content

> **We support free speech — not abuse.**

### 3. Karma Reputation & Leaderboard System
A gamified system to reward valuable anonymous contributions and encourage healthy community behavior.

- ✨ **Karma Score** is based on the amount of anonymous messages a user sends vs. how many are flagged inappropriate by moderation.
- ⚖️ The more appropriate, constructive messages you send, the higher your score.
- 📊 **Formula:** `((Total Anonymous Messages - Total Flagged Messages) / Total Anonymous Messages) * 100`
- 🔎 Use `/rank` to privately check your own karma score.
- 🏆 Use `/leaderboard` to view the Top 10 users by karma.
- 🧑‍🎓 If you've set a custom anonymous name, it will show on the leaderboard. Otherwise, *Anonymous* is displayed. **No real Discord usernames or IDs are shown.**
